\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*., leftmargin=3em]
    \item Hardware Limitations:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item The real-time nature of the bidding system places a constraint on the server hardware, which must be capable of handling high concurrency and maintaining thousands of active WebSocket connections simultaneously without latency.
        \item Clients are assumed to have a stable broadband internet connection. Users on high-latency networks may experience delays in bid updates, which is a constraint of the real-time architecture.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Software and Libraries:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item The frontend implementation is strictly constrained to the React.js library. This dependency requires developers to adhere to a component-based architecture and manage state effectively for real-time updates.
        \item The backend logic must be implemented using the Django REST Framework (Python). This constrains the architectural pattern to Django's MVT model and requires adherence to Python's PEP-8 coding standards.
        \item PostgreSQL is mandated as the database management system to ensure ACID compliance, which is non-negotiable for financial transaction integrity.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Data Privacy and Security:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item The system must not store raw credit card details. Implementation is constrained to using token-based authentication with third-party payment processors to meet PCI-DSS standards.
        \item All user passwords must be hashed using robust algorithms like PBKDF2 or Argon2 before storage, preventing plain-text retrieval.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Compliance with Regulations:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item The implementation must support GDPR requirements, specifically the ability for users to export their data or request account deletion, which constrains the database schema design (cascading deletes vs. soft deletes).
    \end{enumerate}

    \item User Interface Design:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item The design must prioritize the visibility of dynamic elements like the countdown timer and current bid. The interface is constrained to update these elements via DOM manipulation without requiring full page reloads.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Documentation}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=3em]
    \item User Manual:

        \item A frequently updated list of common questions regarding payment security, shipping policies, bid retractions, and troubleshooting login issues.
        \item Format: Collapsible web interface for easy browsing.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*., leftmargin=3em]
    \item Assumptions:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item It is assumed that all end users have access to a stable internet connection with sufficient bandwidth to receive real-time WebSocket updates.
        \item Users are assumed to possess valid payment methods (Credit Card, Debit Card, or digital wallet) for processing transactions upon winning an auction.
        \item The system clock on the hosting server is assumed to be synchronized precisely via NTP to ensure auction start and end times are strictly enforced.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Dependencies:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item Payment Processing: The system depends entirely on third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for handling financial transactions. Any downtime in these services will directly impact the ability to close auctions.
        \item Email Service: The notification system relies on external SMTP providers (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES) for delivering account verification emails and outbid alerts.
        \item Real-Time Infrastructure: The live bidding feature is dependent on the availability and performance of the Redis backing store to manage WebSocket channel layers.
        \item Third-Party Libraries: The project depends on the continued maintenance and compatibility of key open-source libraries (React, Django REST Framework) with current browser and server standards.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

% --- UPDATED SECTION 6: OTHER REQUIREMENTS ---
\section{Other Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., leftmargin=3em]
    \item Database Requirements:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item The system requires a relational database management system (PostgreSQL recommended) to handle complex relationships between users, items, and bids.
        \item The database schema must be normalized to at least the Third Normal Form (3NF) to reduce data redundancy.
        \item Indexing strategies must be applied to frequently queried fields (e.g., item category, end time) to optimize search performance.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Internationalization Requirements:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item While the initial release will be in English, the system architecture must support future localization (i18n).
        \item Currency symbols and date formats should be dynamically rendered based on the user's detected locale settings.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Legal Requirements:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item The platform must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European users, including "Right to be Forgotten" features.

    \end{enumerate}

    \item Reuse Objectives:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., leftmargin=2em]
        \item The authentication module (Signup/Login/Reset Password) should be developed as a standalone component for potential reuse in other company projects.
        \item The real-time notification service should be decoupled to allow integration with different frontend clients (e.g., mobile apps) in the future.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
